# Data Structures & Algorithms

Hey.! I'm studnig and learning DSA from the scratch and I hope this repo will help you out if you are also doing DSA.

**Note:** As soon as I'll move this docs will be updated according to the topics and the code.

## Topics

- Patterns
  - [Pattern #01](./Patterns/Pattern1.cpp)
  - [Pattern #02](./Patterns/Pattern2.cpp)
  - [Pattern #03](./Patterns/Pattern3.cpp)
  - [Pattern #04](./Patterns/Pattern4.cpp)
  - [Pattern #05](./Patterns/Pattern5.cpp)
  - [Pattern #06](./Patterns/Pattern6.cpp)
